
This is a small library to display word clouds, originally intended to
help visualize topic models.  To install run:
    python setup.py install [--user]

For a demonstration try running 
    cd trunk/
    python WordClouds.py

It depends on the following libraries:
    matplotlib >= 1.1
    Quadtree (tested with 1.2)

Running the module as a script will benchmark it.  Here are some rough numbers
for a word weight distribution with fat tails:

    ===================
     seconds     words
    -------------------
         1.0        50
         5.0       300
        20.0       900
        60.0      2000
    ===================

And with skinny tails:
    
    ===================
     seconds     words
    -------------------
         1.0        75
         5.0       500
        20.0      2000
        60.0      5000
    ===================

Note that these numbers measure time to compute the cloud, not time to display
it on the screen.  That will take a few additional seconds.

Currently it has the following dependencies:
    * Quadtree (I used 0.1.2)
    * Matplotlib >= 1.1

For simple use cases try the build_cloud.py script.
